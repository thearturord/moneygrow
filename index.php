            The Forex exchange market is the abbreviation in English of Foreign Exchange Currency Market, that is to say: Exchange Market of Currencies (currencies). Where the trader seeks profits through fluctuations in the exchange rate. </p>

          <p>
            A currency is earned at the top (when bought) and can also be earned when a currency falls (when sold). However, the opposite may occur, that is to say that we are in a position of purchase for a certain currency and this currency instead
            of rising (its price) begins to fall; which would affect our account. </p>

          <p>The same (in the opposite direction) would happen for sales. Therefore it is not as easy as it may seem. The Foreign Exchange Market offers extraordinary profit opportunities, however, keep in mind that it is also a tool of considerable
            risk to invest capital that is part of your savings surplus.

          <p>
            In order for an investment to be successful, it is fundamental to control the risk. Although it is more exciting to focus on the benefits of trade, each investor should also know what they are willing to lose in the investment before
            cutting losses, and also in the account. </p>

          <p>You can control risk in two ways:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>1. retire before the losses exceed the predetermined maximum tolerance ("cut losses").</li>
            <li>2. Limit the size of the position in which a specific account size is invested ("limit leverage").</li>
          </ul>
