          <p>The cryptocurrencies have had an incredible year, with Bitcoin at the helm. It sounds tremendously ambitious and incredible to be able to get the 1 000% return on an investment in a year, and it certainly deserves a lot of attention. However, other cryptocurrencies also had wonderful returns, even though they did not receive as much attention as Bitcoin. In the past, even I myself have focused a lot on Bitcoin, but today we will see other potentially profitable alternatives to Bitcoin and that it is worth knowing to invest.</p>

          <h3>ETHEREUM</h3>

          <p>In my opinion, the Ethereum is the small and ambitious brother of Bitcoin, and has also been at the center of all eyes for some time drawing attention. Earlier this year, the Ether tokens were worth less than $ 10 each. In mid-June, Ether exceeded $ 400 to achieve a return of around 4,000%. The cryptocurrency is now worth around $ 300 and has fluctuated around this price during the past months. Experts predict that its value will increase to reach, and perhaps exceed, $ 1,000 in 2018, depending on price patterns. (Know what awaits Ethereum in 2018 by reading our article Perspectives of Ethereum for 2018).</p>

          <p>As we are seeing in recent days the astronomical values ​​that Bitcoin has taken (see the BTC USD chart) are falling at the same speed with which they went up. The sudden increase in this cryptocurrency in recent months has been attributed to the next bifurcation, since investors would like to receive free coins. To understand this, it is necessary to look back, in the first bitcoin fork, which happened in August to create the Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin Cash made a copy of the Bitcoin blockchain, effectively creating a new cryptocurrency from scratch. The result was that people had private keys for Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin, they received new cryptocurrencies for free. Investors now expect the same with the next fork this month.</p>

          <h3>LITECOIN</h3>

          <p>Although Bitcoin was still unknown by the media, Charlie Lee had already seen potential benefits with the use of this technology. Later, in 2011 he created Litecoin, based on blockchain technology. The code for blockchain is open source, and anyone can access it for free, so we can have as many altcoins as we want, basically altcoins are made almost every two days.</p>

          <p>Anyway, now we have Litecoin as number 5 in the list of all the cryptocoins according to Coin Market Cap. Today, Litecoin has a value of approximately $ 3 billion in market capitalization and each of those coins has a value of $ 280 at the time of publication. The main reason to invest in Litecoin is that it has an excellent rate of return. At the beginning of the year, each Litecoin was worth $ 4.35, which makes the rate of return close to 2 000%.</p>

          <p>For investors, returns are the main reason to invest, but cryptocurrency has also continued the potential growth of daily use. The main use of Litecoin is in the transfer of money, as with Bitcoin. Litecoin also looks like Bitcoin as a form of payment for various goods and services, which means that it will continue to be relevant in the coming years. Actually, it is even preferred at times because it is faster than Bitcoin. The generation of blocks for Litecoin transactions is easier, therefore, confirmations are much faster and transactions less expensive compared to Bitcoin, even through trading with Forex brokers.</p>

          <p>Therefore, like Ethereum, it is considered a solid replacement for Bitcoin, and will continue to be used in the coming months and years.</p>

          <h3>RIPPLE</h3>

          <p>This has been another prominent player in the cryptocurrency industry, perhaps even more so than the rest. In January, the XRP was worth around 0.006380 $, but now it is worth 0.983000 $. If you do the calculations, that gives you more than 3,000% of profits. This cryptocurrency, too, is based on the same blockchain code as the rest, but operates in a completely different way.</p>

          <p>First, the primary form of generation of this cryptocurrency is completely different. To 'make' a new bitcoin, for example, a person has to 'mine' on their computer and receive the virtual currency as a reward. In contrast, Ripple is not mined, but is issued as an incentive to provide the cryptocurrency. Also through business development agreements, those involved can be rewarded with Ripple tokens.</p>

          <p>This difference in philosophy comes from the creators' belief that banks are too essential to ignore. They do not believe in excluding banks to make everything decentralized, but in working with them to make the transfer of money faster, more efficient and cheaper. The Ripple network is actually faster than Bitcoin, Litecoin and other altcoin because it does not require mining.</p>

          <p>What the developers have done here is to appeal to a different market, to corporations and companies, instead of the masses. The result has been the investment of banks interested in technology, and they have increased their market capitalization by more than 8 billion US dollars. In fact, the Ripple has barely fallen below the 5 major cryptocurrencies this year thanks to institutional support.</p>

          <h3>BITCOIN CASH</h3>

          <p>A faction of the Bitcoin developers had decided that they did not like the direction other developers took, so they created the Bitcoin Cash. In his opinion, they believed that the Bitcoin bifurcation, segwit2x, was going to fail, and that users would look for an alternative.</p>

          <p>At first, Bitcoin Cash seemed to be failing, but until now it has proven to be tough and really reliable. Although many of their price movements are the reflection of Bitcoin, there are some minor variations. That makes the Bitcoin Cash more commonly experience the bullish tendencies of Bitcoin than the bearish tendencies of the cryptocurrency king. With more than 10 billion US dollars of market capitalization, it is certainly worth investing in.</p>

          <h3>ZCASH</h3>

          <p>Zcash was born on October 28, 2016, it is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency very similar to Bitcoin. Its composition is practically the same, only 21 million coins will be issued in the future, and the system is also blockchain. What differentiates this cryptocurrency from Bitcoin are 2 things. The first is that it has been created by a company and this can give some more confidence to shareholders and investors and holders of this currency, since, despite having an open source similar to Bitcoin, it is regulated and managed by a company . And the second strong point of this currency is anonymity, if the opacity is a reference in the world of cryptocurrency, with the Zcash we go a step further, in fact, the origin of this cryptocurrency began being an extra layer of anonymity for the Bitcoin and in the end ended up being a totally independent currency. And the Zcash automatically hides the identity of the senders and receivers, as well as the amount of all transactions.
