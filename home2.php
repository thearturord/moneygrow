          <h3>What if you can only aspire to make 10 pips a day? If you get 10 pips per day, that's it ... you're done, no more operations per day.</h3>

          <p>The next day, you come back and take 10 pips again. If you reach the profit of 10 pips of the day, you no longer trade.This means that if you take the first operation and that first operation gives you 10 pips of profit, then you will not do it because the whole objective of this trading system is to make 10 pips a day.</p>

          <p>Now, the problem with this system is: what happens if you do not do 10 pips during the day?</p>

          <p>What happens if you have 10 operations lost? Will you continue trading until you reach 10 pips of profit for the day?</p>

          <p>It is necessary to discuss the issue of security, since at first it is the main obstacle that customers attribute to opt for an online broker. Although the web and email to carry out any type of transaction have considerable advantages, it is necessary to have a minimum knowledge of security to avoid falling into the hands of a scammer (hacker). If the transactions are always made through the web of your broker it is impossible for anyone to intercept those communications. Currently, online banking is totally safe and reliable.</p>
