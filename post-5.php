          <p>The Forex Market (also known as Forex or FX, abbreviation of the English term Foreign Exchange) daily moves a volume of negotiations of around 5 trillion dollars.</p>

          <p>Behind this immense volume of daily negotiations, we will find the so-called "speculators". Scattered all over the world and in attack attitude in order to make a profit from the fluctuations of the price of the coins.</p>

          <p>The currency market revolves around fluctuations in the price of currencies such as: The Dollar, the Japanese Yen, the Euro and the British Pound. There are more exchange currencies and, on many occasions, the big players have created their fortune by negotiating with them.</p>

          <p>Most forex traders keep a low profile, avoid being the center of attention. They build their fortune in silence. From what little is known about them, in a note to The New York Times Joe Lewis said:</p>

          <p>»I really feel that if one is successful, one of the fruits of his success is the quiet enjoyment of it». Lewis does not allow it to be put on the front pages of newspapers.</p>

          <p>Something similar happens with UrsSchwarzenbach, when asked how it is that almost nobody knows him in the currency world, he responds:</p>

          <p>"Everyone has heard of George Soros or Paul Tudor Jones, why should they know of a certain UrsSchwarzenbach?"</p>

          <p>We already revealed 2 names of the 10 most successful forex traders in the world. And who are these great forex players? Next, we will give you a first and last name.</p>

          <h3>1. George Soros</h3>

          <p>The man who broke the Bank of England</p>

          <p>Schwartz György was born on August 12, 1930 in Budapest, Hungary. In 1936 his birth name changes from Schwartz to Soros as part of the plan drawn up by Soros' father, Tivadar Soros, for the concealment of their identities in the face of the extermination of Hungarian Jews by Nazi Germany.</p>

          <p>Soros emigrated to Switzerland in 1946 escaping the Soviet occupation, in 1947 emigrated to England. I work in different jobs at the same time I studied at the School of Economics and Political Science in London. He graduated in Philosophy in 1952.</p>

          <h3>2. StanleyDruckenmiller</h3>

          <p>Earned a $ 1 billion gain by betting on the German mark</p>

          <p>He was born on June 14, 1953 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. He grew up with his middle-class family in the suburbs of Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>Towards the end of 1980, the German mark suffered constant depreciations due to serious political and social complications surrounding the negotiation for German reunification.</p>

          <h3>3. Andrew Krieger</h3>

          <p>Krieger against the kiwi</p>

          <p>After graduating from the Wharton School of Business (University of Pennsylvania), in 1986 he started working at Salomon Brothers for a short period of time before joining the Bankers Trust company.</p>

          <p>His reputation as a businessman grew rapidly, this increased the confidence in Krieger, as a reward the company granted an increase to its capital limit in $ 700 million dollars. A figure considerably higher than the $ 50 million dollar capital limit standard.</p>

          <h3>4. BillLipschutz</h3>

          <p>The sultan of the currencies</p>

          <p>He was born in 1956 in Farmingdale, New York. He attended Cornell University and earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in architectural design, while enrolling in business classes and earning an MBA in finance from the Johnson School of Management and Cornel University.</p>

          <p>He took his first steps in investments while attending college. He started operating in venture capital after inheriting $ 12,000 from his grandmother's death, quickly converted them into $ 250,000, then lost all his capital due to a bad business decision and a market shift. This loss taught him the importance of risk management, which he would then apply for the rest of his career.</p>
