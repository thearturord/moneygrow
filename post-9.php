          <h3>1. Forex is not scam</h3>

          <p>Unfortunately many people are in the Forex currency market Forex are used as an example of pyramid type but it has nothing to do with Forex (Currency Exchange) which is simply the currency market which operates in its different places highlighting the from London, Tokyo, Sydney and New York, distributed among these to operate 24 hours a day for 5 days a week (closes with the New York market on Friday afternoon GMT-3 and opens with the Sydney market the Sunday afternoon GMT-3).</p>

          <h3>2. Actors of the currency market</h3>

          <p>In the forex market, many of the participants are those who trade the big figures daily. These actors are: Commercial Banks, Central Banks, Hedge Funds, Commercial Companies and Private Merchants through brokers that serve as intermediaries.</p>

          <h3>3. Forex is not a regulated market per se</h3>

          <p>Being a decentralized market, there is no regulation that guarantees its regulation. This does not mean that the sea is bigger than the market of the stock markets together. This makes it the most liquid market in the world.</p>

          <h3>4. Forex is a zero-sum game</h3>

          <p>It is very important that you know from the beginning that Forex is a zero-sum game, this means that you earn money, "someone" loses that money and vice versa what makes it something very similar to a poker game (for giving an illustrative example) where everyone can be in spite of their own money so that others can earn it and that is a cause that is found in the market for the merchants (we have all lost money in Forex). It should also be clarified that in fact it is not exactly a zero-sum market since there are commissions / spreads charged by the broker, although it is a negative sum game that is not understood, at least among the participants in the market (traders ) is zero-sum.</p>

          <h3>5. To operate requirements of a Broker</h3>

          <p>In recent years, the Forex market has become quite popular and what used to be an exclusive market for large entities such as Banks, Investment Funds and Central Banks, today any independent trader like you and I can at home invest or speculate in it. through an entity called Broker that works between an intermediary between the market and you. For this you must know the different types of brokers and their characteristics that differentiate them from each other. For this, I have written an article detailing each of them since the choice of the broker is one of the biggest concerns you must have when entering this market (Types of Forex Broker).</p>

          <h3>6. Existing regulations to the Brokers</h3>

          <p>While it is true, Forex can not be a regulated market because it is decentralized, if there are regulations in different countries that apply to brokers and it is transcendental to consider them. The most important is the regulation of the United Kingdom, the FCA (Financial Council Authority) whose regulation is the strictest of all and therefore the most reliable. In the United States there is the NFA that also enjoys reliability and in other countries there are also regulations but less strict than those previously mentioned. Unfortunately NOT in all countries there is regulation (for example here in Chile does not exist) so I personally prefer to operate with brokers that are regulated by the FCA and remember that you will give your money to your broker and it would be really unfortunate that he fell into bad hands.</p>

          <h3>7. You can be provided up to 1000 times your investment to operate</h3>

          <p>A very typical concept of the Forex market is leverage. Thanks to this, the retail trader can access the market and take positions in currencies for an amount much higher than the amount available in his account since some brokers allow leverage up to 1000 times the amount available in the trader's account. For example, with some brokers it is possible to acquire € 1,000,000 with only $ 1000 USD deposit in your account. This without any interest or additional documentation to the required for the opening of the account but the leverage is a double-edged sword since if the position you take is incorrect (upside bets for example and goes down) plays you in against and if you use a leverage of 400 times, it means that only a 0.25% down is enough for your account to close and you have no funds to operateThe leverage is defined in this way 1: 100, always being «1» at the beginning which indicates your deposit (1 time) and on the right the multiplication or credit that you are offered, being in the case of the «100» example what it means that with your balance in the broker's account, they allow you to operate up to 100 times that amount. Because of the danger that this entails and the need to use leverage on the part of those of us who are private traders (we do not have the capital of "Bank of America" or "Citibank"), it is necessary to use the "stop loss", a tool used to stop losses up to a certain margin strategically established by each trader.
          </p>

          <p>It should be noted that corporate traders (Banking) do not use stop-loss or leverage. Given the large capital that banks handle, they do not require the use of leverage to make millions of transactions and therefore are not subject to the risk of suffering a significant loss in percentage terms of their capital in case of having a fall in their positions. they can avoid using Stop-loss.</p>

          <h3>8. 90% of the traders lose money in Forex</h3>

          <p>It sounds incredible but it is true, according to figures given by the brokers in Europe, they show that 90% of traders lose money in the currency market, this due to several factors (which I consider): Excessive use of leverage, operate with a Market Marker broker, lack of psychological control (falling prey to fear and / or greed), over-operating, not having enough experience or knowledge in the operation and not having a "winning" strategy (at least for you). That's why I recommend that you operate in DEMO for months and until you win more than you lose (because it is inevitable to have losing trades) before starting in a real account. This will prevent your learning from costing you part of your capital or everything.</p>

          <h3>9. Factors that influence the fluctuations of the currencies</h3>

          <p>The political decisions, indexes and the historical movement of the price are what determine where the market will move. The interpretation of these data is key to reduce the margin of failure when taking an operation.</p>

          <p>Although it is hard to believe (due to the rapid movement of numbers), the volatility of Forex is lower than that of the Stock Market, so if you do not use leverage, you will hardly have greater losses than the common ones in the case of a downward bag although in some exceptions there are strong jumps as seen in the Brexit and in the last election of Donald Trump as it also occurs in case of war or a terrorist attack, etc ...</p>

          <h3>10. Can you live from trading in Forex?</h3>

          <p>Of course, but the figures say that only 5% could do it (they are the ones who win) so if you think it's easy, no, it's not, but it's not impossible, you just do not have to make the mistakes of 95 % loser and that entails, for example, having a capital according to what you need to earn monthly considering a realistic and sustainable profitability over time. In short, to live on forex or trading in general are three aspects to consider: capital, objective monthly income and average monthly profitability. This will define if you can dedicate yourself and live on trading at 100% or half time and share it with other sources of income.</p>
