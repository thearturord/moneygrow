          <p>We have already discussed many types of forex strategies: high frequency trading (HFT), arbitrage, moving averages, theory of cycles, return of the price to the average, systems of tendencies and ruptures ... But there are still several types of systems of trading, about which we have not had time to talk yet. And one of these types are systems based on the psychology of traders and investors.</p>

          <p>It is hard not to think of the market as a person: your mood can change from irritable to cheerful without apparent cause, then you can react quickly to something and change everything the next day. But can psychology really help us understand financial markets? Theorists in behavioral finance think so. This field of research establishes that people are far from being as rational as the traditional theory of finance describes it. So, let's go to the mess with all that this means and implies.</p>

          <p>Despite the fact that financial behavior points to numerous deviations from rationality, they offer few solutions to make money from the passions of the market. Robert Shiller, author of Irrational Exuberance, 2000, revealed that in the late 1990s, the US stock market. It was in the center of the bubble. But he could not say when it would burst. Similarly, in the fall of the market, specialists in human behavior can not tell us when the market will reach the bottom. However, they can describe how this is likely to occur.</p>

          <p>Human behavior specialists have not yet created a sensible model that really predicts the future, rather than simply explaining what the market has done in the past. The main lesson is that the theory does not tell people how to make a profit. Instead, he says that psychology influences the fact that market prices deviate from the norm over time.</p>

          <p>Financial behavior does not offer investment miracles, but may help you learn to monitor your actions, which in turn will help you avoid mistakes that reduce personal wealth.</p>

          <p>When we talk about the Forex market, our attention is usually directed to the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.

However, there are still other regions around the world where Forex trading is fast becoming an important industry, and one of them is Russia. The Forex industry has been growing rapidly in Russia, and this has required a change in the guideline to increase transparency.
