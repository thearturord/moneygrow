            <p>Hello!</p>

            <p>Welcome to my blog and thank you for stopping by :)</p>

            <p>I have always been someone who liked to help. In a way, this blog is my attempt to "help" in a small way, and I've been thinking of that for years. I explain it.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-1">Why have I started this blog?</h2>

            <p>I would take a moment to explain why I started this blog and what I think is a value that you can draw from it.</p>

            <p>I sometimes wanted to create a website when I was in high school, but I was not sure what I would blog about, but I decided to start a blog anyway. From May 2018 I started to get involved.</p>

            <p>I started my first website in August 2011 with free hosting and domain names. I became interested in blogging. I started learning how to create a blog, how to program and how to manage it. I also created a few blogspot blogs. I read tons of articles and tried different tools to learn the tricks of the trade. My thirst for learning the latest web technologies like HTML and CSS has given me the power of web design.</p>

            <p>I've learned and developed a lot of skills so far and can definitely say that I've grown both professionally and personally.</p>

            <p>I thought maybe I could help others and show them that they also can achieve it. I'd like to share what I have learned so far and what I continue to learn through blogging, so that I can, in a sense, help improve their Forex knowledge.</p>

            <p>Here I share how I learned new things and skills. With the explosion of available online learning options, we can now really learn so many things quickly and at very little cost or almost FREE. You can learn skills that can help you move to a new career, or you can learn things that can help you make money on the side.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-2">Why should you read this blog?</h2>

            <p>There are already many blogs. This blogosphere is full. Few of them really focus on one thing or cover other topics. As you know, there are a lot of exciting things in the blogosphere, but apparently many are overlooked. The goal of my blog is to focus on Forex tips that will help you trade better.</p>

            <p>My primary goal when launching this blog for the first time is to provide you with 100% free, high quality Forex tips step by step. When I say step by step, I mean complete and detailed tutorials that you can go through, instantly implement, and be on the path to online success.</p>

            <h2 class="h2-3">How does these Tips help you?</h2>

            <p>First, this blog is not meant for someone looking for quick fixes, getting rich quick, or for magical "secrets".</p>

            <p>This is for people who want to work smart, get active and learn some cool stuff.</p>

            <p>Here are some reasons why my blog can help you and why you find this blog useful.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Understand how does Forex work</li>
              <li>Creating your own business from home</li>
              <li>Learn all the secrets you need to know to succeed</li>
              <li>Understand the market and how a broker fit on it</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As you read this blog, you will hopefully be inspired to develop a love of learning, and you will see all the information I present as truly valuable. There are so many more that you will see in my blog posts.</p>

            <p>For me, this blog is just like me. I welcome you to send me topics that you would like to discuss. I look forward to your commitment.</p>
