          <p>In the financial markets there are many different brokerage companies that work with their clients.</p>

          <p>Some brokers offer low trade costs and others offer negotiating costs a little higher.</p>

          <p>Some brokers are manufacturers of direct markets, and are on the right side of all operations that directly benefit from their losses.</p>

          <p>And other brokers send their operations directly in the interbank market for execution.</p>

          <p>Some customers take into account their business and their customers only in the short term, and prioritize the quantity over quality. On the other hand, other brokers create long-term partnerships with as many profitable traders as possible. Retail minors are successful.</p>

          <p>In most cases, traders, markets, financial services, commerce, the most important factor, the success of a strategy, the money management system and psychology. However, forget completely that it is the choice of your broker that is defined if you can get a profit or even if you want your profits. In short, you can have the best and most successful trading strategy in the world, but if you operate with a bad broker, the trading strategy will not generate profits.</p>

          <p>Our team is called FX Trading Revolution, we are algorithmic traders, we benefit directly from the financial markets. Our only interest is to provide verified information and trading experience in real time.</p>

          <p>Our team, FX Trading Revolution, has tested hundreds of retail brokers worldwide in real accounts. Unfair brokerage companies do not want you to discover inside information, nor the truth about exactly how financial markets work, nor the principles about how retail brokerage firms work and how they make their biggest profits.</p>

          <p>The professional trader needs, without any type of commitment, a direct commercialization of the interbank market, respectively, a broker that will provide, without any conflict of interests, an execution in the interbank market of each operation.</p>

          <p>More and more, professional traders are realizing that they need STP / ECN trading accounts to succeed. However, do not get confused with the marketing of similar brokers.EL 98 % DE LOS TRADERS CREEN QUE ELLOS OPERAN A TRAVÉS DEL BRÓKER ECN/STP</p>

          <h3>N FACT, ONLY 2% OF TRADERS OPERATE WITH THE REAL INTERBANK MARKET!</h3>

          <p>Virtually every transaction in STP / ECN accounts by a bad broker is sent to a single market maker for an execution - the customers of this broker have a greater conflict of interest, and it is the only market maker usually owned by the broker.</p>

          <p>This is inside information, and it's about how Forex brokers are currently working to get the maximum benefit from their customers, which 98% of retailers do not know. In the image below, you can see that our operations do not run in the real interbank market Insider information: how 98% of retail brokers get their biggest profits!</p>

          <p>A broker that provides access to the interbank market, where all the transactions of its clients are executed, connects its MetaTrader 4 trading platform with a bridge to obtain liquidity for MetaTrader 4 from an interbank market platform and liquidity providers.</p>

          <p>However, similar solutions are usually usable only for hedge funds and large financial institutions. Therefore, only these technologies will guarantee that you do not have conflicts of interest with a bad broker or your market maker, and that your operations will be executed at the best prices in the interbank market.</p>

          <p>Based on the facts mentioned above, there is likely to be a big difference between brokers. A large majority of traders think that their trading strategy is losing due to changes in the market and that it is simply not profitable. But the fact is that many traders are losing money, or are making lesser profits than they could be due to a bad and unfair broker.</p>

          <p>A principle of market makers is very simple - if you get a profit, a market maker loses the same amount of money (that is why trading is sometimes called a zero-sum game). That is the reason why if your operations are executed with a single market maker, they will never do well.</p>

          <p>And if the trader obtains some benefit from a bad broker, the market maker uses fraudulent practices that at first are not obvious - the market maker will look for their Stop-Losses, will expand the spreads at the time of execution of operations, freeze their platform trading meanwhile, and so on.</p>
