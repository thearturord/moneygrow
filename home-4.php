          <p>The creator of the cryptocurrency more in the list of the 50 richest people of the magazine «Forbes» at the time of the strength of this controversial currency that has reached this year the $ 18,000</p>

          <p>Its alive? Dead? Hidden in some secret place? The mysterious identity that hides behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the person to whom the creation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency is attributed, is one of the most intoxicating enigmas of recent years. He is believed to be a Japanese-American citizen who in 2009, and in the midst of the launch of software, will open the network that allows the transfer of bitcoins, the main digital currency - it is estimated that there are thousands of miles.</p>

          <p>The truth is that it has not been specified with a Japanese nationality, it has never been possible to prove that it wrote any text in that language. There are even theories that support the fact that it is rather a group of individuals who have wanted to enrich themselves not so much as plant the seed of a financial revolution. In any case, the idea of the financial idea has not been improved on the foundations of the traditional economic system.</p>
