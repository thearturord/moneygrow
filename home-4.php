          <p>The creator of the cryptocurrency more in the list of the 50 richest people of the magazine «Forbes» at the time of the strength of this controversial currency that has reached this year the $ 18,000</p>

          <p>Its alive? Dead? Hidden in some secret place? The mysterious identity that hides behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the person to whom the creation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency is attributed, is one of the most intoxicating enigmas of recent years. He is believed to be a Japanese-American citizen who in 2009, and in the midst of the launch of software, will open the network that allows the transfer of bitcoins, the main digital currency - it is estimated that there are thousands of miles.</p>

          <p>The truth is that it has not been specified with a Japanese nationality, it has never been possible to prove that it wrote any text in that language. There are even theories that support the fact that it is rather a group of individuals who have wanted to enrich themselves not so much as plant the seed of a financial revolution. In any case, the idea of the financial idea has not been improved on the foundations of the traditional economic system.</p>

          <p>We all have a more or less close idea of ​​what the Stock Exchange is. We can not define it accurately, but several images come to our mind as soon as we hear about this concept. And you, could you tell us what exactly? Do you have any idea how the Stock Exchange works?</p>

          <h3>Stock stock, some general considerations</h3>

          <p>The Stock Exchange, remember, is that space in which shares of companies are bought and sold. It does not exist as such; that is to say, it is not a physical place as they are, for example, the headquarters of companies or financial corporations.</p>

          <p>This does not mean, however, that it has no impact on organizations or physical entities. On the contrary, many of the movements that take place in the Stock Exchange determine the present and future performance of all the companies that participate actively in it.</p>

          <p>When the crisis seemed to put an end to this expansion, neoliberalism has responded with greater virulence. Could the situation that caused the crisis have been avoided? Why has it been done that way? Were not there other alternatives? We have lived beyond our possibilities? What will our lives be like when this tsunami happens? What happens at the macroeconomic level is affecting the environment in which we operate.</p>

          <p>People are at the mercy of the economy with barely layers that isolate us. Until well into the 70s, in Spain, with knowing how to buy, save and invest in a fixed term we had enough. The speed at which changes occur in the economic sphere is much higher than the speed at which we are adapting, so there is a mismatch that we are suffering in some way.</p>

          <p>The OECD PISA report collected a section in 2012 measuring the financial literacy of young people (15 years old) from 18 countries. 13 of them members of the OECD. The results for Spain have not been flattering, obtaining an average score of 484, compared to the average of the OECD countries of 500, being only ahead of Croatia, Israel, Slovakia, Italy and Colombia.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrencies have had an incredible year, with Bitcoin at the helm. It sounds tremendously ambitious and incredible to be able to get the 1 000% return on an investment in a year, and it certainly deserves a lot of attention. However, other cryptocurrencies also had wonderful returns, even though they did not receive as much attention as Bitcoin. In the past, even I myself have focused a lot on Bitcoin, but today we will see other potentially profitable alternatives to Bitcoin and that it is worth knowing to invest.</p>

          <h3>ETHEREUM</h3>

          <p>In my opinion, the Ethereum is the small and ambitious brother of Bitcoin, and has also been at the center of all eyes for some time drawing attention. Earlier this year, the Ether tokens were worth less than $ 10 each. In mid-June, Ether exceeded $ 400 to achieve a return of around 4,000%. The cryptocurrency is now worth around $ 300 and has fluctuated around this price during the past months. Experts predict that its value will increase to reach, and perhaps exceed, $ 1,000 in 2018, depending on price patterns. (Know what awaits Ethereum in 2018 by reading our article Perspectives of Ethereum for 2018).</p>
