          <p>Despite the fact that financial behavior points to numerous deviations from rationality, they offer few solutions to make money from the passions of the market. Robert Shiller, author of Irrational Exuberance, 2000, revealed that in the late 1990s, the US stock market. It was in the center of the bubble. But he could not say when it would burst. Similarly, in the fall of the market, specialists in human behavior can not tell us when the market will reach the bottom. However, they can describe how this is likely to occur.</p>

          <p>Human behavior specialists have not yet created a sensible model that really predicts the future, rather than simply explaining what the market has done in the past. The main lesson is that the theory does not tell people how to make a profit. Instead, he says that psychology influences the fact that market prices deviate from the norm over time.</p>

          <p>Financial behavior does not offer investment miracles, but may help you learn to monitor your actions, which in turn will help you avoid mistakes that reduce personal wealth.</p>

          <p>Differences between theoretical and behavioral finances are best seen as follows: theory is the foundation on which one can build to improve understanding of the subject, and behavioral aspects are a reminder that theory does not always work as expected. Consequently, a good knowledge of both points of view can help you make better decisions.</p>

          <p>The idea that financial markets are efficient is one of the basic principles of modern portfolio theory. This principle, defended in the theory of an efficient market, assumes that, at a given moment, prices fully reflect all the information available about a particular market. Since all market participants know the same information, no one will have an advantage in forecasting profitability, since no one has access to information that is inaccessible to others. In efficient markets, prices become unpredictable, therefore, the patterns are not traceable, which completely denies any planned approach to trading. On the other hand, research on financial behavior that studies the impact of investor psychology on courses reveals some predictable patterns in markets.</p>

          <p>In theory, all the information is distributed equally. In fact, if it were true, then the use of privileged information would not exist, there would never have been an unexpected bankruptcy. There would be no need for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002), which was designed to drive markets towards higher levels of efficiency. And let's not forget that personal preferences and personal skills also play a role. Obviously, there is a gap between theory and reality.</p>

          <p>In theory, everyone makes rational decisions. Of course, if everything were rational, there would be no speculation, bubbles and irrational exuberance. Nobody would buy when the price is high, and would not sell in panic when the price falls. Without taking into account the theory, we all know that there is speculation, that the bubbles grow and explode.</p>

          <h3>THE HYPE CYCLE (HYPE CICLE)</h3>

          <p>In 1995, the Gartner consultancy introduced the so-called "Hype cycle", or technology maturity curve.</p>

          <p>Since then, Gartner regularly publishes a graph of technology maturity, in which it points out at what stage an innovation is currently. These publications are closely controlled by investors to understand when and in what to invest.</p>

          <p>This is a typical development of Hype, not only for technologies, but also for any event in the markets. In fact, the reaction to any news can be placed in such a pattern. Renaming the stages of the first image according to the market.</p>

          <p>It is clear that the model is idealized. In reality, the configuration may have differences (as, in fact, for the primary cycle for the technology), but the main thing remains a sequence of stages, expressed in price changes.</p>

          <p>Let's see the work in reality. The Hype cycle for annual data on the US GDP, published on January 30, 2019:</p>

           <div class="logo-wrap">
              <img class="logo-test" src="img/graf1.jpg" alt="">
           </div>

          <p>In this case, the Forex chart fits the model well, since the news is solid and pulls the blanket on itself. In general, many events occur simultaneously in markets, and Hype cycles can overlap and influence each other, ultimately, in price.</p>

          <p>An example of a long-term Hype cycle are the peaks of Bitcoin. But there you can call them directly Hypes. A Bitcoin chart is a direct link between financial market charts and Hype's main cycle for technology:</p>

            <div class="logo-wrap">
               <img class="logo-test" src="img/graf2.jpg" alt="">
            </div>

          <p>In a market where we can enter into sales, it seems a good idea to sell in a reversal based on the lowest point of the turn. By the way, for the news that makes the market fall, the same applies upside down, when interesting purchases occur in the pullbacks. (Know everything you need to know about trading Forex on Fridays)</p>

          <p>However, the pattern is intuitive and, surely, many of you went to him independently. Personally I met several traders who operated under this model (although they did not know what it was).</p>

          <h3>LOCATION OF OPEN POSITIONS OF TRADERS</h3>

          <p>As you have probably already understood, traders and investors (even professionals) often make mistakes when trading in the markets and are motivated by their emotions. Therefore, another completely logical idea would be to use your mistakes for our purposes. This is the principle behind the famous Supremacy trading strategy, which can be found in the Forex strategy section of our Forex blog. You can also see the Alligator indicator, which allows you to track the mood of the traders on the trading platform.</p>

          <p>Some people think that if it goes against the crowd, it will always work, because the crowd is constantly wrong. The crowd really loses money in the long term. But not because the trend is being predicted constantly wrong. Most determine them correctly, since it is not difficult or otherworldly.</p>

          <p>Observing the open positions of retail traders when the price approaches significant levels of support / resistance, trend lines, before important news, all this will allow you to look behind the retail market scene and understand what emotions are hidden in the market. head of the average Forex speculator.</p>

          <p>There are many tools to analyze the open positions of traders. Many great brokers have their own tables.</p>

          <p>Of course, we all hear that over 90% of people lose money in the forex market. But, as we have said, this does not mean at all that, in a given period of time, more than 90% of the traders incorrectly predict the movement of the market. According to a simple study that we gave at the beginning of the article, the problem is different. Human psychology is such that it is more likely that at the beginning it will obtain benefits from its operations by closing them as soon as they enter green and let the negative operations run until the end in which it can not be more. According to statistics, the average profit for traders in the EURUSD pair is 48 points, and the average loss is 83 points. This is a difference of almost 70%, and it is critical.</p>

          <p>Therefore, Forex traders lose more money in unprofitable trades than they earn in profitable trades. A normal retail trader is extremely vague, not very disciplined: he does not know how to work with risks and money. From here there is a typical paradox: most predict the movement of the price (the trend line is not so difficult to draw), but do not know how to make money with it.</p>

          <p>Also, do not forget that these are data in the retail currency market. An ordinary retail trader, as a rule, jumps a lot and rarely holds an open position for more than 2 days, which should be considered when analyzing your transactions. Keep in mind the fact that the entire retail currency is less than 15% of the total foreign exchange market, a small niche. Therefore, use the data of the retails traders as another market forex indicator, which will allow you to obtain another clue about the movement of the market.</p>

          <p>Pay special attention to the strong imbalances. If you see an overbought or oversold in a given currency pair of 80% or more, this may indicate a reversal. Look for limits, extreme values, inconsistencies, market "vulnerabilities", which is confirmed by several correlations.</p>

          <p>In fact, there is little data available to analyze this approach, and it is not easy to find a history of changes in the proportion of positions for at least one of the currency pairs. But I am sure that from this idea it is possible to build a profitable system, you only need to collect this data and thoroughly test the strategy in a sufficient amount of them. To convince yourself of the convenience of doing more research.</p>
