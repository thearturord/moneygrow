          <h3>What if you can only aspire to make 10 pips a day? If you get 10 pips per day, that's it ... you're done, no more operations per day.</h3>

          <p>The next day, you come back and take 10 pips again. If you reach the profit of 10 pips of the day, you no longer trade.This means that if you take the first operation and that first operation gives you 10 pips of profit, then you will
            not do it because the whole objective of this trading system is to make 10 pips a day.</p>

          <p>Now, the problem with this system is: what happens if you do not do 10 pips during the day?</p>

          <p>What happens if you have 10 operations lost? Will you continue trading until you reach 10 pips of profit for the day?</p>

          <p>Well, if that is the case, you need to make a profit in the next 11 operations and it is the 11th operation that will give you the 10 pips you need for the day.</p>

          <p>But then, that is a big problem, because now you face the problem of overestimating and you really do not know if the next 10 operations will be all winners ...</p>

          <p>So with this Forex trading strategy of 10 pips a day, in my opinion, you should have a limit set on the number of trades lost before saying: "that's it, no more trades for today".</p>

          <h3>Trade rules of the 10 pips strategy per day</h3>

          <p>Sales configuration: Sells when 5 crosses 12 descents and RSI crosses below 50.</p>

          <p>Place the stop loss 2 pips above the maximum of the previous candle that was closed before the crossing of the ema. Take the profit target that is 10 pips.</p>

          <p>Purchase settings: Buy when 5ema crosses 12ema higher and RSI crosses above level 50. Place the stop loss 2 pips below the minimum of the previous candle that was closed before the ema crossing.</p>

          <p>Take profit target = 10pips.</p>

          <h3>Disadvantages of the 10 pips strategy per day</h3>

          <p>You can not use the strategy in pairs that have large spreads.</p>

          <p>This is a trend currency trading strategy, so if the market is flat, you will have many false signals, which I suggest you use this strategy only during the trading sessions in London and New York.</p>

          <p>You are only restricting yourself to a profit of 10 pips per day when, sometimes, the trade you do will see later that you have moved 50 pips or 100 pips, but you only made a profit of 10 pips, so do not despair because The avarice
            breaks the bag.</p>

          <p>The tendency to trade excessively and get your 10 pips a day, which means you can easily fly your forex account if you do that.</p>

          <h3>Advanteges of the Forex trade strategy of 10 pips per day</h3>

          <p>It is a fairly simple trading system that can be used even for beginning forex traders.</p>

          <p>It works very well in markets with strong trends.</p>

          <p>The profit target of 10 pips is easily achieved compared to something like the profit target of 50 pips.</p>

          <h3>Fundamental analysis in Forex</h3>

          <p>
            Fundamental analysis is a way of observing the market by analyzing the economic, political and social forces that affect supply and demand in the currency market. For this it is important to know the main events and macroeconomic data of
            the world economy, a good tool to know when they are going to officially produce these economic ads is the Forex economic calendar.
          </p>

          <p>
            The fundamental analysis starts from the fact that if the current or future economic perspective of a country is good, its currency will be reinforced. If the demand for a country's goods and services increases, or the number of people
            who want to invest there is growing, they will need to buy the currency of that country before they can buy their goods or invest and then the value of the currency is likely I went up.
