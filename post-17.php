          <p>We have already discussed many types of forex strategies: high frequency trading (HFT), arbitrage, moving averages, theory of cycles, return of the price to the average, systems of tendencies and ruptures ... But there are still several types of systems of trading, about which we have not had time to talk yet. And one of these types are systems based on the psychology of traders and investors.</p>

          <p>It is hard not to think of the market as a person: your mood can change from irritable to cheerful without apparent cause, then you can react quickly to something and change everything the next day. But can psychology really help us understand financial markets? Theorists in behavioral finance think so. This field of research establishes that people are far from being as rational as the traditional theory of finance describes it. So, let's go to the mess with all that this means and implies.</p>

          <h3>Psychology and market efficiency</h3>

          <p>The idea that psychology moves the market goes against the established theory that markets are efficient. Advocates of the effective market hypothesis say that any new information falls quickly on market prices through an arbitration process.</p>

          <p>Behavioral specialists explain that irrational behavior is not an anomaly, but something common. In fact, the researchers were able to reproduce market behavior using very simple experiments.</p>

          <p>Here is one of the experiments: offer someone the option to get $ 50 and the opportunity to flip a coin and win $ 100 or win nothing. Most likely, the person chooses $ 50. On the contrary, if you offer a choice between losing $ 50, we take that person $ 50, and the possibility of losing $ 100 or not lose anything, then the person will probably want to flip a coin. The ability to flip a coin is present in both scenarios, but people will go for it to save themselves from losses, although they may lose even more. People tend to think that being able to recover losses is more important than being able to earn more profits.</p>

          <p>The priority of avoiding losses is fair for traders. Just think about how popular are the different trading methods to recover lost money and martingales. Regardless of how low the price has fallen, traders believe that it will eventually rise again, and keep unprofitable positions open until they reach the margin.</p>

          <p>The herd instinct explains why people tend to imitate others. When the market goes up or down, traders believe that others know more or have more detailed information. The consequence is that traders feel a strong desire to do what others do.</p>

          <p>The behavior of finance also found that traders tend to put too much emphasis on the comments or criteria of a small sample of data or individual sources. For example, it is known that if an analyst chooses winning actions, operators attribute this to skills, not luck.</p>

          <p>On the other hand, the beliefs of traders are not easy to shake. In the late 1990s, long-term traders embraced for the belief that any sudden drop in the market was a good time to buy. On the other hand, this point of view still reigns supreme. Traders are often overconfident in their judgments and tend to rush into the single "talk" item, instead of listening to the most obvious medium.</p>

          <h3>Why do people behave so badly with their money?</h3>

          <p>In the decision-making process, people use facts as factors, but they act under the influence of emotions. Even if you think you're working with a cool head, you're wrong. There is no magic button that, even for a short time, can completely deactivate the emotional component.</p>

          <p>In the world of statistics, there are classifications for different types of variables. These are the rules that guide research and trading decisions. They are related to the way we analyze the models and perform stress tests to achieve statistically significant results, and how we finally make decisions. These variables are procedural and highly controlled.</p>

          <p>Imagine being taken to a police station to testify. The police will conduct a survey according to their procedure. Will you look at real suspects? Will you show the photos? If so, will the photos be shown one by one? Or six pieces at a time? At this moment, will the officer look at me over my shoulder? What gender, race and age will the officer be in relation to the witness? Or in relation to the suspects? This is a choice that must be made during a specific procedure.</p>

          <p>Now imagine your mental state when you are sitting in a police station. How can your mental and emotional state change according to the nature of the crime? What would happen if a weapon were used in a crime, would it focus on the weapon or the attacker? With what confidence will you answer the questions if the crime happened an hour ago or a day ago or a week ago? If it happened next to or far from your house? Is it more or less likely to point to a picture that matches your race or gender? Are tattoos intrusions or creative personalities?</p>

          <p>All of these are "context variables", as they relate to you and the context surrounding your individual decision-making process, in our case, your ability to provide reliable testimony.</p>

          <p><b>It exists a link between the variables of the system and the variables of the context, which are not completely independent of each other.</b> For example, the optimization of the variables of the system through the implementation of procedures that reduce the anxiety of the witness and the period between Crime and clarification of circumstances can help stabilize other volatile context variables, leading to more accurate testimony from the eyewitness.</p>

          <p>Trading works in the same way. We constantly strive to explore new methods, integrating ideas when appropriate, and introducing variables into the work system that show great statistical significance. And we know that if we succeed, it is most likely that, for other volatile context variables, we obtain the suppression effect. In simple words: <b>if we develop a system that provides stability and growth, and at the same time we try to suppress the influence of context variables as much as possible, that system will be easier to follow, and the probability of incorrect decisions will be minimized. due to emotions and monetary losses in this regard...</b></p>
