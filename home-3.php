          <p>In the financial markets there are many different brokerage companies that work with their clients.</p>

          <p>Some brokers offer low trade costs and others offer negotiating costs a little higher.</p>

          <p>Some brokers are manufacturers of direct markets, and are on the right side of all operations that directly benefit from their losses.</p>

          <p>And other brokers send their operations directly in the interbank market for execution.</p>

          <p>Some customers take into account their business and their customers only in the short term, and prioritize the quantity over quality. On the other hand, other brokers create long-term partnerships with as many profitable traders as possible. Retail minors are successful.</p>

            <h2>Why will I do not invest in bitcoin or cryptocurrencies?</h2>

          <p>I write this after seeing in the news that "bitcoin loses more than 30% of value in its worst week since 2013". We are more than used to hear that the bitcoin collapses and shoots up. Normally, an investment with this degree of volatility is only assumed by very expert speculators and yet in my environment I know many people who are investing in bitcoin. Globally, alarming things are being heard that should be of concern to regulators.</p>

        <h3>Why do many people invest in bitcoin?</h3>

             <p>Bitcoin and its technology brought the promise of having an anonymous exchange medium without intermediaries. Actually, this already exists: pay in cash. The advantage of paying with cryptocurrency would be to make it easier to pay at a distance. However, in the real world, buying something with bitcoin or transferring funds - for example to a relative in another country - is not easy at all. There is no app that makes it easy even though many startups are trying it. And even if it becomes usable, the fees are so high that it would not be worth it. Using it to send money to another country and exchange it for traditional currency using a bitcoin ATM can cost 15% commission between issuance and withdrawal.</p>
