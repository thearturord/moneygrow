          <h2 class="h2">Risk Control</h2><br><br>

          <p>
            In order for an investment to be successful, it is fundamental to control the risk. Although it is more exciting to focus on the benefits of trade, each investor should also know what they are willing to lose in the investment before
            cutting losses, and also in the account. </p>

          <p>You can control risk in two ways:</p>


          <p> 1. Retire before the losses exceed the predetermined maximum tolerance ("cut losses").<br>

            2. Limit the size of the position in which a specific account size is invested ("limit leverage").</p><br>


          <h2>Cut losses</h2><br>

          <p>
            Often, investors with little experience are too focused on avoiding transactions with losses. They tend to let losses increase with the "hope" that the market will change in their favor and the losses will turn into profits.
          </p>

          <p>The best investment strategies usually include loss-cutting procedures. When an investor takes bearish positions, often too many emotions arise and it is difficult to cut losses correctly. It is best to decide when the losses will be cut
            before starting any investment. Thus the investor knows in advance the maximum limit that can be lost in said investment.</p>

          <p>Controlling the overall risk of the account is another key factor in controlling risk. In other words, each investor should know, before they start investing, how far they are willing to get the losses in their account before stopping to
            invest and rethink their strategy. If you opened an account with $ 2,000 USD, would you be willing to lose the $ 2,000 USD? $ 1,000 USD? As in individual investments, the essential thing is to set a limit and not exceed it.</p><br>

          <h2>Determine the size of the position</h2>

          <p>Before starting an investment program, you have to analyze how much you could lose in the account over a certain period, by lot (drawdown). For example, suppose you have considered that your maximum loss in an investment is 30 pips. This
            would translate to approximately $ 300 USD for a position size of $ 100,000 USD. Suppose now that a position of $ 100,000 is equivalent to a lot. In five consecutive transactions with losses, it would lose $ 1,500 USD (5 x $ 300), which
            would be a difficult period, although not unexpected, in a long-term investment. For an investment account of a lot of $ 10,000 USD, this would result in a loss of 15%. Therefore, although it is possible to invest 5 lots (or more) with a
            $ 10,000 account, this analysis suggests that the "cut" would be too large (at least 75% of the value of the account would be canceled).</p>

          <p>Every investor must consider how much he can lose, at most, per lot before deciding how much he wants to invest in order for the account to lead to tolerable "cuts".</p><br>

          <h2>Financial Education in Forex and Investments in General</h2>

          <p>Studies have shown that a large part of the population thinks or dreams, about having their own business, or being financially independent someday. However, it is important to understand basic premises about personal, family, business
            and investment economics in general before entering such a dangerous world.</p>

          <p>Many experts criticize entrepreneurs, retail investors and forex traders, for not taking the time necessary to understand the frame of reference and the structure of how this world works. Anyone who wants to operate needs Forex education
            and investment in general terms to be successful.</p>

          <p>Therefore, if you are thinking of starting a business, start trading in the Forex world or invest in the financial markets, from Eagles investors we suggest you to use it thoroughly, and prepare a strategy that begins with your financial
            education.</p>
