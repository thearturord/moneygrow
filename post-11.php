            <p>Although after reading the Beginner Trading course, you are no longer a "Forex newbie", we advise you to start trading with a free demo account (click below) before operating with a real account.</p>

            <h3>Demo account - Forex for beginners - What is Forex</h3>

            <p>Forex, or the forex market is also the market where currencies are traded. In its simplest form, a currency transaction can be, for example, when you convert your local currency to a new one for a future vacation. Around the whole market, about 5.3 million dollars are quoted daily between governments, companies, corporations and speculators.</p>

            <p>Knowing how the industry is projected is important, because the combination of all the participants creates the market in which it operates. The relative weight of the share of trade in the market is measured by the amount of money that administrative part. Including hedge funds, investment banks, and traders with a few kilometers of dollars in stock.</p>

            <p>Currencies are traded as pairs, and the movement of currency pairs measures the value of one currency against another. For example, the currency pair EURUSD measures the value of the euro against the US dollar.</p>

            <p>When the value of the pair increases, this means that the value of the euro has increased against the value of the US dollar. When the value of the pair decreases, this means that the value of the US dollar has increased (or the value of the euro has decreased). By trading Forex and CFD, traders can profit from these currency movements.</p>

            <h3>Best currency pairs</h3>

            <p>Forex currency pairs are known as major, minor and exotic. The main currency pairs are formed by the currencies that are negotiated more frequently, which are:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>USD - The US dollar</li>
              <li>EUR - The Euro</li>
              <li>JPY - The Japanese Yen</li>
              <li>GBP - The British Pound</li>
              <li>CHF - The Swiss franc</li>
              <li>CAD - The Canadian Dollar</li>
              <li>AUD - The Australian Dollar</li>
              <li>NZD - The New Zealand Dollar</li>
            </ul>

            <p>An important currency pair is one that contains any of these matched currencies against the US dollar, such as EUR / USD, USDJPY or GBPUSD. Forex pairs of pairs composed of these major currencies that do not include the US dollar. These pairs include:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>EURGBP</li>
              <li>EURCHF</li>
              <li>AUDNZD and so on.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Finally, exotic currencies are any currency that we have not mentioned before, such as:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The Hong Kong Dollar (HKD)</li>
              <li>The Norwegian Crown (NOK)</li>
              <li>The South African Rand (ZAR)</li>
              <li>The Baht Tailandés (THB)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When learning about Forex Trading, many beginners tend to focus on the main currency pairs due to their daily volatility and their adjusted spreads. But there are many other opportunities, from exotic currency pairs to trading opportunities with CFDs on stocks, commodities, energy futures and indices.</p>

            <p>There are even indexes that track groups of indexes, and you can also negotiate them.</p>

            <p>The number of markets in which you invest depends only on you. Although we advise you not to focus on a single market or instrument. Limiting the market can lead to overvaluation, so be sure to diversify your investment.</p>

            <h3>CFDs</h3>

            <p>If you have been researching currency trading, you may have seen the term "Forex CFD" at some point. There are two ways to operate in Forex by using CFDs or Forex spot:</p>

            <p>Spot Forex involves buying and selling the real currency. For example, you can buy a certain amount of pounds sterling per euro, and then, once the value of the pound increases, you can exchange your euros for pounds again, receiving more money compared to what you originally spent on the purchase.</p>

            <p>The term CFD means "Contract for difference", and is a contract used to represent the movement in the prices of financial instruments. In Forex terms, this means that instead of buying and selling large amounts of currency, you can benefit from price movements without having to own the asset itself. Along with Forex, CFDs are also available in stocks, indexes, bonds, commodities and cryptocurrencies. In all cases, they allow you to operate with the price movements of these instruments without having to buy them.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in learning how CFDs work in more detail, we recommend the following article: What is CFD Trading?</p>

            <h3>Quotes</h3>

            <p>When you trade with Forex, you will see that the prices of 'Ask' and 'Bid' are quoted:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>The offer price is the price at which you can buy the coin</li>
              <li>The sale price is the price at which you can sell it</li>
            </ul>

            <p>One of the advantages of trading Forex with CFDs is that you can trade both long and short. You have to be aware of the risks involved when dealing with a complex product.</p>

            <p>Long operation: The purchase of a currency with the expectation that its value will increase and obtain profits for the difference between the purchase price and the sale price.</p>

            <h3>How much do the currency values change (or how are Forex currency pairs of different values)?</h3>

            <p>If the way brokers make profits is by charging the difference between the purchase and sale prices of currency pairs, the following logical question is:</p>

            <p>How much can you expect a certain currency to move?</p>

            <p>This depends on how the liquid currency is or how much is bought and sold at the same time. The most liquid currency pairs are those that have the highest supply and demand in the Forex market. It is the banks, companies, importers, exporters and traders that generate this supply and demand.</p>

            <p>The main currency pairs tend to be the most liquid, with the EUR / USD currency pair moving at 90-120 pips on an average day.</p>

            <p>Conversely, the AUD / NZD pair moves between 50 and 60 pips per day, and the USDHKD currency pair only moves at an average of 32 pips per day (when observing the value of the currency pairs, most will appear with five decimal points.</p>

            <p>Note: The value of 1'pip 'is 0.0001</p>

            <p>Therefore, if the EUR / USD moved from 1.1667 to 1.1677, that would represent a change of 1 pip.</p>

            <p>The main Forex pairs tend to be the most liquid and, therefore, provide the most opportunities for short-term trading. However, there are also many opportunities between minor and exotic currencies, especially if you have some specialized knowledge about a certain currency.</p>
