      <p>The creator of the cryptocurrency more in the list of the 50 richest people of the magazine «Forbes» at the time of the strength of this controversial currency that has reached this year the $ 18,000</p>

      <p>Its alive? Dead? Hidden in some secret place? The mysterious identity that hides behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, the person to whom the creation of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency is attributed, is one of the most intoxicating enigmas of recent years. He is believed to be a Japanese-American citizen who in 2009, and in the midst of the launch of software, will open the network that allows the transfer of bitcoins, the main digital currency - it is estimated that there are thousands of miles.</p>

      <p>The truth is that it has not been specified with a Japanese nationality, it has never been possible to prove that it wrote any text in that language. There are even theories that support the fact that it is rather a group of individuals who have wanted to enrich themselves not so much as plant the seed of a financial revolution. In any case, the idea of the financial idea has not been improved on the foundations of the traditional economic system.</p>

      <p>Because of its philosophy, cryptocurrencies do not require intervention or a specific regulator to operate. It works through a "block chain" or "block chain" technology that allows a worldwide accounting ledger to be launched. A brilliant conception that is conceived for multiple applications, although it has been the transfer of digital money that has generated greater interest. It is a form of payment that has in the encryption of data the endorsement of its material value, is developed collectively through an open source platform and without the control of any regulatory body. Fear of a bubble</p>

      <p>Over time, bitcoin has grown exponentially. Today has exceeded $ 18,000 in value, which has raised doubts about whether it is a speculative bubble or if, on the contrary, we are facing a refuge value that is submerged in a revolution. In any case, currently 40% of bitcoins belong, only, to only a thousand people, which in turn has contributed to feed the most reluctant positions to this type of monetary system emerged in the Internet era.</p>

      <p>So much has been that impulse that has taken the bitcoin that its creator has gotten into the list of 50 richest personalities in the world elaborated by the magazine «Forbes». Positioned in 44th place, Nakamoto is credited with a fortune close to 19,400 million dollars (16,433 million euros) thanks to its 980,000 own cryptocurrencies that have been able to link. A figure that places him behind Stefan Persson, the largest shareholder of the well-known clothing chain Hennes & Mauritz (H & M).</p>

      <p>In recent years there has been speculation about his figure. Who? Are you hiding for fear of being robbed or attacked? There have been several people who have been linked. Names and surnames that have passed without any certainty, feeding the monster and sketching a volcano that, for the moment, remains inactive. In 2014 the magazine «Newsweek» claimed in a report that a 64-year-old Japanese-American citizen by the name of Dorian Nakamoto who was the same name was the creator of the Bitcoin virtual currency, but finally denied being the «father» of the invention.</p>

      <p>A mystery that has spread in several chapters. Already in 2011 it was pointed out that Finnish economic sociologist ViliLehdonvirta and a young cryptography student Michael Claro operated under the pseudonym Nakamoto. The same year in which several indications were published that suggested that the experts Neal Rey, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry had created the Bitcoin network, something that they also denied outright.</p>

      <p>The never ending story continued in 2013 when Japanese mathematician Shinichi Mochizuki was targeted as the "father" of the cryptocurrency. There were even attempts to link the Bitcoin with Ross William Ulbricht, supposed creator of a black market, Silk Road, which operated on the so-called "deep web" or "deep internet", which worked until his arrest four years ago.</p>

      <p>Craig Steven Wright, an Australian academic and entrepreneur of 46 years, has been the name that has had most strength as a precursor of the decentralized currency. He was arrested in 2015 and last year claimed that he was Satoshi Nakamoto. An announcement that uncovered hours later the doubts of the experts, who lamented that it was mere publicity of their companies, causing Wright had to go publicly to retract. He did it without giving any obvious evidence, thus passing a new page of a story of enigmas and mysteries.</p>
