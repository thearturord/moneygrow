          <p>When we talk about the Forex market, our attention is usually directed to the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States. This is because these are the most active regions in the currency market and have the greatest impact on the market as a whole. However, there are still other regions around the world where Forex trading is fast becoming an important industry, and one of them is Russia. The Forex industry has been growing rapidly in Russia, and this has required a change in the guideline to increase transparency. In this article, we will look more closely at the current state of the Forex industry in Russia and the changing regulatory environment.</p>

          <h3>WHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION OF THE FOREX MARKET IN RUSSIA?</h3>

          <p>To understand how the Forex market is currently in Russia, we should first see the size of the market itself. Only then can we establish the regulatory framework in the area and understand the changes that are coming to the industry in 2019.</p>

          <b>Growth of the foreign exchange market in Russia</b>

          <p>It is no secret that it is possible to earn a lot of money in Forex. If you have been a successful trader for several consecutive years, then this should be obvious. If we look at some of the most successful traders of all time, we can also see that - it is possible to make huge profits with only a small number of trades. - Knowing this, then it should come as no surprise that the industry has been growing rapidly in Russia with more and more people coming together to have the opportunity to earn money. Also remember that Russia has one of the fastest growing economies in the world.</p>

          <p>As a result, many Forex dealers also made their services available, leading to a large number of brokers. A LeapRate reporter was quoted as saying that there were more than 200 Forex brokers offering their services in the country and about 500,000 customers who operated with them. While it may not be a huge number for a country with more than 100 million people, it represents a rapid increase in the number of traders since retail trading began to be popular at the turn of the century.</p>

          <h3>Increased fraud on the Forex market in Russia</h3>

          <p>Wherever a well-run industry thrives, scammers will always find a way to interfere with it and make quick money. This is exactly what happened in Russia as soon as the Forex market started to grow. The problem became so widespread that even the police began issuing warnings regarding Forex scams. In January 2018, Tolyatti police issued a warning following a complaint filed by an individual who had been defrauded. Apparently, this person had been invited by a broker to his real office for a presentation on investment opportunities. The distributors explained in complex terms how they would invest their money and make huge profits.</p>

          <p>This individual was just one of many who were deceived by the same broker under the same promises. In fact, other victims had gone so far as to sell their apartments and other properties to raise capital with the conviction that they could recover everything ... and more. From then on, the broker quickly transferred the swindled money to bank accounts abroad, which makes it irreversible and not recoverable by the police. Unfortunately, the name of this particular broker was not disclosed by the police, so we could not warn others against these professional scammers.</p>

          <p>Another more popular case of Forex fraud involved six suspects who had been administering another fraudulent broker. The scam was carried out between 2012 and 2013, urging investors to deposit their money in managed accounts that would be used to operate in the currency markets. After a few months, the "broker" closed his chiringuito and disappeared with an approximate amount of 32 million Russian rubles of all his clients. The police searched the offices and arrested the scammers, and the mastermind was 3 years and 2 months in jail. In addition, individuals were also required to return the money they stole, which is probably why jail sentences were shorter than expected.</p>

          <p>These types of cases have become very common in Russia, which shows that cases of fraud have increased. Fraud in the Forex market is nothing new for the industry anywhere in the world, as we have already commented and seen in previous articles. In fact, some other scammers have managed to steal much more money from their customers. The only difference is that Forex regulators in more stringent jurisdictions often these scammers are caught and face very severe jail terms and large fines. In Russia, it seems that sentences are somewhat lenient, and this gives scammers more confidence in their activities. However, it is encouraging to see that the authorities are not only resting on their laurels, but that they are actually doing something.</p>

          <h3>DIRECTRICES OF FOREX IN RUSSIA</h3>

          <p>The police, prosecutors, courts and everyone else involved in ensuring transparency in the Forex market can not act on their own, but must operate according to a set of guidelines. Therefore, we must observe the current guidelines that guide the Forex market in Russia, the changes they have undergone and their impact on the markets.</p>

          <h3>What is the regulatory body in Russia?</h3>

          <p>For decades, there have been no direct guidelines to govern the Forex market and the Forex brokers in Russia. Perhaps this is the reason why there have been so many cases of Forex fraud and scams in the country for so long. The problem had become so serious that even government institutions and officials simply saw the industry as a game and it was not worth considering. For example, the vice president of the Central Bank, Sergey Shvetsov, once said: "the Central Bank does not assist in the growth and expansion of the foreign exchange market". He went further and said that "the Forex market is a casino" intended only for customers who want to bet "and is not" an asset for investment. "</p>

          <p>Due to the total lack of guidelines, victims of fraud had no recourse because even the authorities really could not do anything about it. As a result, the scammers were able to escape their activities because one could not prove they had been scammed. The thing is that when you "choose" to participate in an unregulated business, you are essentially consenting to your rules, those that the authorities can not monitor.</p>

          <p>Due to the rampant fraud in Russia, the good and loyal brokers who ran their companies from Russia were often criticized and avoided; they all thought that they were also swindlers. Of course, not all were, but that was the general impression. It stifled the growth of the industry in the country and prevented many people from achieving their dreams. Considering that there was so much potential in Russia, some innovative people formulated a plan: to create their own regulatory body that did not depend on the government, which was already very disinterested. After all, several Forex trading technologies, successful traders and good brokers are from Russia, just think about MetaQuotes, creator of the MetaTrader trading platform.</p>

          <p>An entrepreneurial Forex trader created the Financial Market Relations Guidelines Center (FMRRC) in 2011 to act as a regulator. All legitimate brokers at that time obtained an FMRRC certification to prove they were legitimate and not swindlers. Because the institution was created by a dealer with knowledge of the markets, they only certified other legitimate brokers who knew they had good business practices. In this way, traders looking for a trusted Forex broker had a more reliable list to choose from and avoid scams. They also established a compensation fund for their certified clients so that the claimants would be compensated.</p>

          <p>The idea was very innovative and helped reduce Forex fraud, but only to a certain extent. First, the FMRRC has no authority, since the Central Bank has never granted it any recognition as the governing body. This means that, even if a broker licensed by FMRRC commits a fraud, the institution can not take them to court and process them. Second, the institution itself was not very adequate in its actions. Their website did not keep the list of certified brokers updated, which makes it difficult for traders to identify real brokers. Other important information about the past of the certified brokers and the details were not kept updated or available either. Finally, the FMRRC operated on the basis of its own set of rules, which may not be completely fair.</p>

          <p>Remember that the institution remained alive thanks to brokers seeking accreditation, so this body had incentives to adapt their rules in a way that would be more suitable for brokers instead of traders who pay nothing. Over time, the FMRRC became more of a certification body rather than a regulatory body, losing its reliability among traders and brokers.</p>

          <p>Then, in December 2014, the Russian government began to take seriously the need to implement guidelines in the Forex market, and planned to start regulating the industry. President Vladimir Putin promulgated the Russian law on the Forex and began the countdown so that the brokers would comply or be processed. Maybe you finally recognized that the Forex industry is, in fact, a legitimate financial area that is worth regular or just got tired of all the scams and frauds, we will never know. All we know is that the state Duma proposed a set of rules to govern the Forex markets, and these rules were activated on May 2, 2017. However, the rules were active since the beginning of 2016 after several discussions with Forex traders throughout the year 2015; May 2 was just the deadline for compliance. Under these new guidelines, the Central Bank of the country becomes the main regulator for Forex traders, eliminating the need for the FMRRC.</p>

          <p>Today, brokers seek the FMRRC as an additional certification to increase their status, but only the approval of the Central Bank of Russia matters. Given that it has been given authority as a law of Parliament, the central bank actually has the authority to prosecute any broker who does not comply with the rules, unlike the FMRRC. So far, the central bank has only issued nine licenses, which means that these are the only brokers authorized to operate legally in Russia.</p>

          <h3>What are the laws that govern Forex trading in Russia?</h3>

          <p>And we are finally here, in the real rules that govern Forex operations in Russia, what many Russian traders and foreigners have been waiting for, who can operate in Russia because of their commercial conditions, sometimes better than European brokers. To understand the full scope of these laws, we must analyze how they control Forex brokers and traders, and we will do it separately. On the side of brokers, the laws are intended to increase transparency and avoid the appearance of fraudulent brokers. To this end, the first measure of the guidelines is to allow traders who can only operate in brokers authorized by themselves. As in many other jurisdictions, the central bank of Russia requires that all brokers that request customers in their area have a license. Brokers must also become members of the Association of Forex Brokers, Association of Forex Dealers (AFD), which is a self-regulatory organization approved by the central bank. The structure is somewhat similar to that of the US, where brokers obtain a license from the CFTC and must also be members of the NFA.</p>

          <p>As we have already mentioned, only nine brokers have a license so far, including Alpari Forex, Forex Club, InstaForex, Trust Forex, TeleTrade, FINAM FOREX, VTB 24 and Promsvyazbank. These are also the only authorized brokers to advertise their services to clients in Russia. In September 2017, the central bank issued a press release stating that they were going to block 400 websites belonging to unlicensed brokers. The blocked websites include fraudulent companies or courses, but also legitimate brokers licensed in other jurisdictions. This was possible because the Ministry of Economic Development drafted a bill that allows Russian authorities to block foreign websites. Therefore, all web pages for foreign brokers that have not yet received a license from the Russian Central Bank may be blocked to prevent access by Russian residents.</p>

          <p>For a broker to obtain a license, he must prove to have a net capital of 100 million Russian rubles (approximately 1.6 million US dollars). For brokers who have more than 150 million Russian rubles in customer deposits, they must have even more capital to obtain approval. Then, the broker must deposit 2 million Russian rubles in the AFD self-regulatory organization. Finally, they must have a real basis in Russia to allow close monitoring, and a thorough tracking in case of a complaint. This means that even foreign brokers must establish themselves in Russia before obtaining approval from her as well. For these foreign brokers, their requirements go further. This foreign Forex broker must have a 5 year experience in the field of finance and be regulated to perform this function. Also, they can not be regulated by an offshore regulator, which probably means that their foreign regulator must also be in Europe. Many other documents, including recommendations, financial statements, etc., will also be needed before you can obtain that license from the Central Bank of Russia.</p>

          <p>In addition to licensing brokers, the central bank also determines the scope of the services it can offer. Brokers licensed in Russia can only offer Forex trades in currency pairs, but can not offer CFD trades. As you know, many brokers offer other assets such as stocks, indices and commodities in the form of CFDs instead of real assets. However, for traders in Russia, they will have to give up these other trading instruments and stick only to currency pairs. Once a broker meets all these requirements, you are ready to start and can start registering customers without any worries.</p>

          <p>For traders, the only limit is on the amount of leverage, which has been limited to 50: 1. This leverage could increase depending on the financial instrument in question, but the limit rarely goes beyond this. Binary options have also been banned in Russia, and brokers are not allowed to provide this instrument. This is not surprising considering that almost all other Forex regulators have done the same.</p>

          <p>It will also be difficult to create an account with a Russian Forex broker, since customers must provide reliable identification for later verification. This would probably mean entering the broker's office and presenting your identification documents before opening an account. They made this a necessity to avoid money laundering by individuals, similar to what the Chinese did with crypto exchanges; maybe even for the same reasons.</p>

          <h3>WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF THE FOREX GUIDELINES IN RUSSIA?</h3>

          <p>The steps already taken by the government to protect traders are commendable and highly anticipated, but much remains to be done. As we have discussed above, the laws that govern the Forex markets in Russia are not completely clear with respect to all aspects, and this means more amendments before they are complete.</p>

          <p>The laws must be modified in such a way that they protect the customers and at the same time allow a healthy competition between the brokers, since that is how they improve their game. People will also appreciate an easier way to participate in markets without too many obstacles; After all, others have succeeded. For now, we can appreciate the steps already taken and expect even more improvements.</p>

          <p>Finally, we leave you with a video about whether it is really profitable to invest in the stock market in the long term, and what is the real difference between trading and investing in the long term, and answer the question of what are the differences in terms of costs, in terms of performance, and in terms of effort.</p>
