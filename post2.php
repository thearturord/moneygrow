          <p>
            Improve the lifestyle, have extra income, make money online are the characteristics that make trading one of the most sought after and sought on the internet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trading has become fashionable in recent days, now the ease of investing allows anyone to do it, the many commercials of celebrities such as James Rodriguez and others encourage investment, the financial crises that drive you to look for
            other ways to earn money and the result of Google when someone looks for how to get rich or how to make money online.
          </p>

          <p>
            Trading is buying and selling assets in order to have a profit in the transaction, as in any other business, buy cheap and sell expensive.
          </p>

          <p>
            The assets can be shares of companies such as Apple, Facebook, Google; currencies in the Forex market such as euro, dollar, yen; raw materials such as gold, oil, soybeans; to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple.
          </p>

          <p>
            Technology, ease of access and the evolution of devices for personal use have allowed this activity is not exclusive of banks financial entities or people with a lot of money, low intermediation costs and the number of tools facilitate
            access so that anyone can invest.
          </p>

          <p>
            But not everything is rosy. Most people who invest for the first time in these markets lose their money because they do not know what it is, although it sounds easy as any business has its technique and requires dedication.
          </p>

          <h3>How can I start investing?</h3>

          <h4>- Open a demo account</h4>

          <p>These are free practice accounts that simulate the behavior in real time of the markets and allow you to invest with money of lies for you to practice and understand the operation, this is a great tool since it is one of the few
            businesses in which you can learn without losing money.</p>

          <h4>- Educate</h4>

          <p>
            Although James sums it up in three steps, it really requires learning to manage the operations platforms, analyze graphs and interpret news. This can be learned by any person does not have to be good with numbers or be financial, is a
            skill that is improved with practice; but it is important to have a training before risking the capital.
          </p>

          <h4>- Choose a broker</h4>

          <p>
            The broker is the financial intermediary, is the one who does the work of a stockbroker to choose one is necessary to see that it is regulated preferably in the United States or Europe.
          </p>

          <h4>- Do not believe in magical promises</h4>

          <p>
            This is perhaps the most important aspect, robots, signals, strategies are the most frequent searches of people who are starting in this world and although all are not scams a great majority if, suspect when they guarantee a monthly
            return. It is important to always keep in mind that speculative markets are variable and nobody can guarantee profitability.
          </p>

          <h4>"For me trading is a lifestyle that allows me to work on other things that I like, be financially calm, choose when I want to work and when not."</h4>

          <p>
            The road to being an investor has not been easy but it is very rewarding. I have been investing in the stock market since I was 15 years old and this has made me grow financially in an intelligent way.
          </p>

          <p>
            In these years as an investor I can tell you two things: The first thing is that they do not believe in everything they are told to investigate, read, watch videos; In the YouTube channel of Investopi we have a lot of content to solve
            your questions. The second is that they do not seek to imitate what another person does, not because that person does well, it means that it will work the same, when talking about investment you have to take into account risk profile,
            time to manage investments, the amount of the investment and according to this, choose the risk and the instrument in which it is going to invest.
          </p>

          <p>
